Wow Yes


I first took this file and used a hex to UTF-16 translator in Google.
That gave me a long string of characters belonging to various languages of the world

This is the string I got:
༎ࠇउࠈഈ഍ࠈഈЄ഍൤撆༂ЀЎ਌ਏ밎ਊఎ༊ڼʼ밴Ȃ�ฎฌຫชఎꬎฎ༅܁एཛ഍ฎฎญชฎฎਊ฀̏਍ഌఊ؀༏ጊጅ

And hence after translating using google translate, this is the flag I got
